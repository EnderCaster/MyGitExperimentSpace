# About pep 8
we use 4 spaces instead of tab (vscode do this)
we use brackets for a very long condition like "if", "while"
we use right bracket when close brackets with line break
we use 79 lenth as line max length, for docs and comments, it's 72
\ is acceptable, and recommand to use in-brackets line break when parameter is very long
UTF-8
import one module one line
no space between brakets and vars
no space between comma and vars when comma is behind

more readable
